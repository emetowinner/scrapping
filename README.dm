# Icat Scrapping Script

##This Script will automatically make a call to the Icat XML server of user specified endpoint and save the respones to the data.xml file
##Note the default XML data in the data.xml file was pulled from icat open data server endpoint and will always be overwritten each time the script executes.
##The xml_run.py file can't be imported as a module, it should be run as a script because it was not pakaged as a module.

#The code is written in python 3.7 and make sure you have the request library installed
